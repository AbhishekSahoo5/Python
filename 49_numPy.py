'''
-->NumPy is the short form of Numerical Python
--> In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy package.
--> NumPy is a package that defines a multi-dimensional object and associates
 fast math functions that operate on
 --> I also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra Fourier
 Tranformation and Matrices.
 --> In simple Words, it is the fundamental package scientific computing in python.

'''
Array
------
--> An array is defined as a collection of items that are sorted at 
contiguous memory locations.

--> It is a container which can hold a fixed number of items, and these 
items should be of the same type.

--> A combination of arrays saves a lot of time. The array can reduce the 
overall size of the code.

'''

'''
Advantages of Using Arrays:
---------------------------
--> NumPy uses much less memory to store data.
--> Numpy makes it extremely easy to perform mathematical operations on it.
--> Used for the creation of n-dimensional arrays
--> Finding elements in NumPy array is easy.
'''

'''
Arrays vs list
----------------
--> List cannot directly handle Mathematical Operations, while Array can.
--> An Array consumes less memory than a list
--> Using an Array is faster than list
--> A list can store different datatypes, while you can't do that in an array.
